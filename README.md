## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I'm **LaxmiPrasad Konduri**, a high school student from Aurora, Illinois passionate about the intersection of **business strategy and computer science**.  
Through school clubs, internships, and independent projects, I’ve built skills in:
- Analytical problem-solving  
- Programming and data organization  
- Finance, investing, and business decision-making  

This portfolio is a snapshot of that journey — from learning algebra and coding to building tools that make sense of real-world data.
